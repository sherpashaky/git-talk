Git
---

Git is a distributed version control system.

It's pretty first to get started with and can soon become very addictive as it makes
your work easy and fun. It stays out of your way.

IMHO, for a software developer, git is the best thing since sliced bread. Why do I say so?

* It's easy to get started
    - just create your project directory
    - mkdir git-talk
    - cd git-talk
    - add files to your project e.g a readme file
        cat > README.md
        This is the git talk project
        Ctrl + d
        echo "git is awesome" > overview.txt
    - Now, to create a git repository you use the command
    $ git init  # this creates a git repository in your project folder i.e .git folder
        - you do not need to be connected to the internet or network to get started
    - It is important to configure a name for the author for your repository, it becomes
      easier to indicate that you are the author of the work when you make commits.
    $ git config user.name "Ukang'a Dickson"
    $ git config user.email ukanga@gmail.com
    $ git status  # shows the status of your repository and staging information
        - i.e which files are untracked - not yet added to the repository
        - modified
        - staged for commit: Note you can stage files for commit, and still make changes
          to this files without loosing your changes, i'll show you that in a second
    $ git add README.md overview.txt  # stages files for commit, adding files to your repository
    $ git commit -m 'initial commit'  # commits staged files into your repository,
                                      # creates a hash that you can reference the commit
    $ git log  # view your commit history, shows author, hash reference
*
